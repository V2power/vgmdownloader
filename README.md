## About

This program uses web scraping with  [BeautifulSoap](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to download OSTs (Original Sound Tracks) from [this site](https://downloads.khinsider.com).

## How to compile it

First of all you are going to need [Python](https://www.python.org/) and two depedencies, [BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) for the web scrapping and [Requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/install/#install) to help us with the HTTP requests.

```python
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install requests
```

Now you're ready to run the program!

```python
python vgmdownloader.py
```


~~A little tip is to search the uncomplete name of the game or album you want to download, for example:
Search for **"Streets of"** and not the full game name like __"Streets of Rage"__. _(Trust me it will work better this way.)_~~
[f06c3cb](https://github.com/V2power/vgmdownloader/commit/f06c3cbd8e62d78ffb4b2160f5401d2f7a9bcdde) - Now you can search however way you want.

### Tips

Download a good music player, in my case I use [MusicBee](https://www.getmusicbee.com/).
